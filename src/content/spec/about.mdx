# 自 留 地 / Reserve Plot

Hi!

I'm sharing my notes and open-source projects here.

Most of the posts would be in English coz writing tech stuff in Chinese has been kind of alien to me now. Ironically I do apologize for my poor English writing.

The current version you are visiting is forked from [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) template by saicaca, which is something lightweight yet complete to me, so I think it is a good start. I'm trying to edit the style of this site and make it more "drab" or old-fashioned. But honestly I'm not quite fond with those front-end web staff, the Astro is pretty unfriendly to me already. So I guess it would be a long run.

Something you might be interesting in:

- The Fuwari project:

- The X-DIY manual (in Chinese) I used to write on:
